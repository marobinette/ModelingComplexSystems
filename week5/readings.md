I like the idea of getting creative with the concept of "intraguild predation". For instance, it could be fun to model a zombie apocalypse scenario in which zombie don't just bite humans, but also compete for the same resources (shelter, territory, easy targets), creating the mathematical conditions for societal collapse through chaotic population swings. Maybe you even model a scenario in which Zombies eat plants, but not just any plants, the same plants that can be processed to create a cure for zombie bites.
